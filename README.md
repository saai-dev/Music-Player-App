🎧 Music Player App

A clean and minimal music player web application that allows users to play audio files from a local playlist. The app focuses on simplicity, smooth controls, and a modern glassmorphism-inspired UI without unnecessary complexity.

This project demonstrates audio handling in JavaScript along with clean UI interactions using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

🚀 Features

Play and pause audio tracks

Next and previous track controls

Static playlist using local audio files

Progress bar with current time and total duration

Click-to-seek functionality

Keyboard shortcuts for basic playback control

Clean hover interactions without visual clutter

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the player

CSS – Styling, layout, and glassmorphism effects

JavaScript – Audio control, events, and UI updates

⚙️ How It Works

Audio files and album cover images are stored locally inside a single songs folder

A static playlist array defines track details (title, artist, audio file, cover image)

JavaScript controls playback using the HTML5 Audio API

The progress bar updates in real time as the track plays

Users can seek within a track or switch songs using controls or keyboard shortcuts
